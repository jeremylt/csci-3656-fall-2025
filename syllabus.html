<h2>Diversity, Equity and Inclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#diversity-equity-and-inclusion" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The College of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of Colorado Boulder is committed to fostering a diverse, inclusive and academically excellent community.</p>
<p>The college’s diversity and inclusion plan dovetails with the CU Boulder Inclusion, Diversity and Excellence in Academics (IDEA) Plan and is informed by the university’s longstanding efforts to create a place where everyone feels a sense of belonging and where everyone can succeed.
As a university and college community we affirm that making excellence inclusive is an active, intentional process that engages students, faculty and staff across the curriculum and community and in our offices, labs and meeting spaces.
Moreover, our plan addresses the Chancellor’s three strategic imperatives: shape tomorrow’s leaders, innovate and positively impact humanity.</p>
<p>As laid out in the Dean’s Strategic Vision, we aim to be the premier destination for every engineering student in the state of Colorado while attracting outstanding students from across the country and world by increasing and supporting communities traditionally underrepresented in engineering and applied sciences to thrive in our college.
In doing so, we will drive and support economic growth in Colorado, foster collaborative industry partnerships that prepare students to work in diverse teams and succeed in the global marketplace and to produce ethical, resilient and creative engineers who will become leaders in their fields.</p>
