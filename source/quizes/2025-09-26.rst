3) Sketch a diagram showing the decomposition of a 2D vector :math:`a` into its projection onto a unit vector :math:`v`, given by :math:`\left( a \cdot v \right) v`, and the projection orthogonal to the unit vector :math:`v`, given by :math:`a - \left( a \cdot v \right) v`.
Assume that :math:`a` is not parallel or orthogonal to :math:`v`.
